# Penguin Web Animation

![Penguin](screenshot.png)

## Overview

This is a fun and creative web animation featuring a cute penguin standing on a snowy ground with mountains and the sun in the background. The penguin's elements, such as its face, eyes, beak, and arms, are animated to give it a lively appearance.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## How It Works

The animation is created using HTML and CSS, with no JavaScript involved. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

- **Mountain Background**: The mountains in the background are created using gradient backgrounds to give the illusion of depth.

- **Sun**: The sun is a simple circular element placed in the top-right corner of the screen.

- **Penguin**: The penguin is the main character of the animation. It consists of various elements, including the head, face, eyes, beak, blush, shirt, body, arms, and feet. These elements are styled and positioned to create the appearance of a cute penguin.

- **Penguin Animation**: The penguin has a subtle animation when clicked (`:active` state), making it appear as if it's slightly bouncing.

- **Mountain Layering**: The mountains are layered to create a sense of distance, with one mountain in the foreground and another in the background.

- **Grassy Ground**: The ground is created using a gradient background to resemble a snowy, grassy surface.

## How to Use

To view this penguin animation, simply open the HTML file (index.html) in a web browser. You can also modify the HTML and CSS to customize the animation or integrate it into your own projects.
